# Mumble Letters Kata

The goal of this kata is to implement the `mumble_letters()` method which takes a string as input and returns a formatted output string. The output string contains sequences of repeating letters with each letter repeated a number of times based on its position in the input string i.e. the 3rd letter in the string is repeated 3 times. Each sequence of repeated letters is separated with a hyphen(-) and the first letter of each sequence is capitalised.
