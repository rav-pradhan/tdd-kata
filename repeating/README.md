# First Non-repeating Character

Given a string, find and return the first non-repeating character. Do not account for case sensitivity when tallying up the frequency of a character, but what is returned has to be in the case that it's inputted in.

E.g.

```go
fmt.Println(FirstNonRepeating("Stress")) // returns 't' instead of 'S'
```
